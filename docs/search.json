    "section": "",
    "text": "Image by Unsplash\n\n\nIn the early 2013, around March, I was getting an interview on the 500 Fortune company, where my interviewer asked me a difficult question and I said I don’t know, but somehow I got the Job.\nMy career started even before that. In 2011-2012, during my last year of studies and close to graduation day I spent around a year to do side projects with my lecturers, from geological mapping, seismic interpretation, joint-study field evaluation, basin modeling, to petrophysical analysis.\nNot until 2013-2014, where I got my first industrial role in Jakarta, the capital city of Indonesia, moving away from freelance project in Yogyakarta. Here I mostly worked on petrophysical analysis, evaluating more than 100 wells in clastics and carbonate reefal reservoir, helping the team to update their static model. We planned to do EOR (waterflooding) at the time, so simulation is very critical before economical decision was made.\nFast forward to March 2014, through some luck and intentional effort, I managed to secure an interview with my current employer for an entry level position as petrophysicist/ geoscientist. The interview was a bit “drama” at first, cause the interviewer was changed at the last minute. Nerveousness was at its peak.\nHowever, somehow I got to meet the interviewer, answer few tehnical questions and non-technical questions. Right before we end the interview, she asked me the final technical questions. The question is about intutitive meaning of when density and neutron log is overlayed each other. She said she just need a straightforward answer, two words not more.\nI knew at that time that I have no idea what was supposed to be the answer to the question, but I was too afraid that I would mess my chance to get the gig. I was not esactly remembered how long I take the time to answer, but eventually I come to a conclusion – I should be honest.\nI said:\n\n“I Do Not Know”.\n\nIt took her 5 seconds, and as she smiled she said:\n\n“Well, I Do Not Expect you to be able to Answer the question given the limited experience you have with well logs”\n\nShe explained to me that the question is to test me. She knew that I would probably did not know the answer to the question, her target was to know whether I will spit out my honest truth (that I dont know), or try to be smart by spitting some BS. I was glad I choose the first.\nTo me this was one of the biggest moment in my career, where you should always try to be honest with yourself in an interview. At the end of the day, you would not want to be in the same team with a person who you cannot trust.\nCredibility, given how “small” the world of energy industry, should not be treated lightly. Furthermore, connection, was built upon trusts. You will be surprised, how many times I have seen “a guy/girl” got the gig just by “knowing someone”.\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{ariewijaya2022,\n  author = {Aditya Arie Wijaya},\n  title = {My {First} {Interview} in 500 {Fortune} {Company}},\n  date = {2022-08-29},\n  url = {ariewjy.github.io/posts/01-my-first-gig},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nAditya Arie Wijaya. 2022. “My First Interview in 500 Fortune\nCompany.” August 29, 2022. ariewjy.github.io/posts/01-my-first-gig."

    "text": "Photo by Kelly Sikkema on Unsplash\n\n\n\nStatic Website Triumph\nStatic website is a website built upon a pre-rendered html generated from markdown. Static website triumph because the markdown format makes it easier for writing (at least for me), offered flexibility to write Latex to write equation like \\(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3\\), a code block like this, or below, which makes it suitable for blog about programming/ data science.\n\nprint(\"Hey There!\")\n\nThe simplicity makes it easier to pour your words into sentences, sentences into a paragraph. You can focus about writing the content you want to write, instead of fiddling around about CMS. 1\nMy first personal website was initially built using jekyll-theme. I think the looks of the website is quite nice, given how easy for me to just forking the repo and making it my own. The theme is from al-folio theme, and by default it was designed for academic, supporting CV, list of publications (which handling bibtex better than Quarto at the moment), and of course blogging with categories, etc.\nI was convinced that static website is the way to go for me, but Jekyll-based theme is not as friendly-used as I thought It would be. For once, it uses Ruby Gem, which I am not familiar with and frankly the development is rather behind other languange. That means you have less change of finding answer online, compared to other language.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nI had multiple occasions where I just undo the whole thing, because when I ran bundle exec jekyll serve, it won’t render. Some dependencies issue, etc. Personally, if you plan to add more content to your blog, I would look the other way.\n\n\n\n\nQuarto by Posit 2\nEnter Rstudio Conference 2022, where a good amount of people gather in annual meeting for R-people. Among other important announcement (including changing their name to Posit, they introduced Quarto, an open source project to bring scientific communications easier and more inclusive.\nWhat is good about Quarto is it combines what was good about Rmarkdown, and make it more inclusive (as it drops the R from its name). Even more, the compatibility to pandoc engine, makes it easier to convert it from and to other format, this includes jupyter notebook, which is a huge plus for me. Mainly because I worked primarily in python, and the fact that I can work on jupyter notebook, do EDA, and when I am ready to post I just have to render the file before upload it to the website is godsend.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn order to make an .ipynb file can be rendered by quarto, it has to provide two things. One is the raw cell where the frontmatter (first cell in the image below) is, and second is the frontmatter has to specify which kernel/ jupyter would it use (mine is set to python3). See example image below, or read the docs for python for details.\n\n\n\n\n\nJupyter lab Example\n\n\nIf you prefer a tutorial video, I highly recommend Isabella’s video, in which she show some practical step-by-step when making a blog using quarto. \nNot only that, quarto allows use to generate multiple format from presentation (revealjs, pptx), article, report in pdf or docx, easily from a single markdown .qmd file. I’d probably write a post explaining about that in the future. Perhaps diagram below would simplify why I liked Quarto flexibility.\n\n\nCode\nflowchart LR\n  A[.ipynb] --> B(.qmd)\n  B --> C{quarto render}\n  C --> D[.html]\n  C --> E[.pdf]\n  C --> F[.docx, .revealjs, etc]\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n  A[.ipynb] --> B(.qmd)\n  B --> C{quarto render}\n  C --> D[.html]\n  C --> E[.pdf]\n  C --> F[.docx, .revealjs, etc]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLastly, and here is my most favourite part (believe it or not) is the code block allows for copy and paste button! I tried to create a code block in my previous blog, and it just grey rectangular with no copy-paste button. I think this is an essential feature, as the theme is reproducible science. You wanted the minimize the barrier as low as possible, and this will definitely help.\n\n\n\nWhat Quarto Lacks\nThe good thing about quarto (simplicity) can be a cons for some people. When comparing to my previous website built on Jekyll, the default theme quality is still subpar. I need to do some personal tweaks to make it more appealing visually. Luckily, you don’t have to invent the wheel, as there are several blogs I used as inspirations for their custom theme. Below are some of my favourite authors, in no particular order.\n\nIsabella\nDanielle Navvaro\nTom Mock\nMatt Worthington\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can use their website repo as inspiration, on how they change the font theme, size, page layout, blog setting, color theme. Pay attention to their _quarto.yml and theme.scss!\n\n\nLast but not least, the quarto project is still in develop\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nThis is one of the thing I am struggling when trying wordpress.↩︎\nPreviously R Studio.
