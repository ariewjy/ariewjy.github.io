    "title": "My First Interview in 500 Fortune Company",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Image by Unsplash\n\n\n\nIn the early 2013, around March, I was getting an interview on the 500 Fortune company, where my interviewer asked me a difficult question and I said I don’t know, but somehow I got the Job.\nMy career started even before that. In 2011-2012, during my last year of studies and close to graduation day I spent around a year to do side projects with my lecturers, from geological mapping, seismic interpretation, joint-study field evaluation, basin modeling, to petrophysical analysis.\nNot until 2013-2014, where I got my first industrial role in Jakarta, the capital city of Indonesia, moving away from freelance project in Yogyakarta. Here I mostly worked on petrophysical analysis, evaluating more than 100 wells in clastics and carbonate reefal reservoir, helping the team to update their static model. We planned to do EOR (waterflooding) at the time, so simulation is very critical before economical decision was made.\nFast forward to March 2014, through some luck and intentional effort, I managed to secure an interview with my current employer for an entry level position as petrophysicist/ geoscientist. The interview was a bit “drama” at first, cause the interviewer was changed at the last minute. Nerveousness was at its peak.\nHowever, somehow I got to meet the interviewer, answer few tehnical questions and non-technical questions. Right before we end the interview, she asked me the final technical questions. The question is about intutitive meaning of when density and neutron log is overlayed each other. She said she just need a straightforward answer, two words not more.\nI knew at that time that I have no idea what was supposed to be the answer to the question, but I was too afraid that I would mess my chance to get the gig. I was not esactly remembered how long I take the time to answer, but eventually I come to a conclusion – I should be honest.\nI said:\n\n“I Do Not Know”.\n\nIt took her 5 seconds, and as she smiled she said:\n\n“Well, I Do Not Expect you to be able to Answer the question given the limited experience you have with well logs”\n\nShe explained to me that the question is to test me. She knew that I would probably did not know the answer to the question, her target was to know whether I will spit out my honest truth (that I dont know), or try to be smart by spitting some BS. I was glad I choose the first.\nTo me this was one of the biggest moment in my career, where you should always try to be honest with yourself in an interview. At the end of the day, you would not want to be in the same team with a person who you cannot trust.\nCredibility, given how “small” the world of energy industry, should not be treated lightly. Furthermore, connection, was built upon trusts. You will be surprised, how many times I have seen “a guy/girl” got the gig just by “knowing someone”.\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{ariewijaya2022,\n  author = {Aditya Arie Wijaya},\n  title = {My {First} {Interview} in 500 {Fortune} {Company}},\n  date = {2022-08-29},\n  url = {ariewjy.github.io/posts/01-my-first-gig},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nAditya Arie Wijaya. 2022. “My First Interview in 500 Fortune\nCompany.” August 29, 2022. ariewjy.github.io/posts/01-my-first-gig."

    "text": "Introduction & Objectives\nHealth insurance plays an important role in future financial planning. Insurance members are required to pay a routine payment (insurance rates) to the insurance company. This rate will be used to pay medical bill of the insurance members. therefore, determination of insurance rate becomes a critical component to ensure the sustainability of the insurance.\nIn this project, the author wanted to do an exploratory analysis based on known variable that may correlate with the medical bill of the said members. This project will be using personal medical bills dataset (insurance.zip) as the main source1, along with the included metadata below:\n\nage: age of primary beneficiary\nsex: insurance contractor gender, female, male\nbmi: body mass index, providing an understanding of body, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height, objective index of body weight (kg/m2) using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 24.9\nchildren: number of children covered by health insurance / number of dependents\nsmoker: smoking\nregion: the beneficiary’s residential area in the US, northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest.\ncharges: individual medical costs billed by health insurance\n\nAt glance, bmi and smoker would likely to induce a high medical cost of a person, while age, sex, children and region may contribute in some senses or the others.\nObjectives:\n\nAnalyze the relationship between multiple variables to medical charges\nCharacterize the risk profile of members, based on the said analysis\nDetermine if the insurance rate can be optimized for each risk profile"

This needs further check, as what would affect the scattered data across this category, as it looks like there is another factor (aside from what was plotted already) that affects the data “moves up” (increased medical charges)\n\n\nWhat affects the outlier/ I-a group?\n\n\nShow Code\n(sns\n.relplot\n (data=insurance.query('smoker == \"no\"'),\n  x='age',\n  y='charges',\n  hue='bmi_class',\n  # size='children',\n  style='sex',\n  legend='full',\n  col='children',\n  col_wrap=2,\n  # row='region',\n  height=3, \n  aspect=1,\n#   markers=[\"8\",\"P\"],\n  # s=400,\n  palette='tab10',\n  alpha=0.7,\n  # size_order=['obese', 'overweight', 'healthy', 'underweight'],\n )\n);\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Outliers vs number of Children\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7 shows just group I and I-a where we see through zero to six number of childrens, colored by bmi_class and styled by sex. As can be seen, there is no clear differentiator between group I and I-a, as the number of children increases, it affects both group I and I-a also.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nIt is unclear as to why this is happening. Perhaps other factors plays a role. At the time of this writing, author decided to categorized the group I-a as the outlier.\n\n\n\n\nShow Code\ng = (sns\n.relplot\n (data=insurance,\n  x='bmi',\n  y='charges',\n  hue='smoker',\n  size='children',\n  # style='sex',\n  # legend='full',\n  # col='bmi_class',\n  # col_wrap=1,\n  height=3.5, \n  aspect=1,\n  markers=[\"8\",\"P\"],\n  palette='tab10',\n  size_order=[1,2,3,4,5,6]\n )\n)\n\n#annotations\ng.fig.text(0.35, 0.25, \"I\",\n   color=\"black\", fontdict=dict(size=18), fontweight='bold'\n          )\n\ng.fig.text(0.35, 0.45, \"II\",\n   color=\"black\", fontdict=dict(size=18), fontweight='bold'\n          )\n\ng.fig.text(0.6, 0.65, \"III\",\n   color=\"black\", fontdict=dict(size=18), fontweight='bold'\n          )\n\ng.fig.text(0.5, 0.45, \"I-a\",\n   color=\"black\", fontdict=dict(size=18), fontweight='bold'\n          )\n\nplt.suptitle('bmi vs charges', y = 1.05);\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: BMI vs Charges\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilar to the previous Figure 5, in Figure 8 we can see that the non-smoker group overlaps with the smoker group at around 16,000-30,000 medical charge range."

    "text": "Conclusions and Outcomes\n\nThe insurance member can be characterzed based on the smoker profile, age, bmi/ bmi_class, and sex profile.\nThe critical factor for a high medical charges is whether member is a smoker or not, followed by age and then bmi2.\nOther variable such as the number of children/ dependant is not playing a role, whereas sex profile affect the charges slightly3.\nThere is a strong relationship between age and medical charges, with 3 strong group categorized by smoker and bmi profile. The big three groups are:\n\nGroup I: medical charges below 16k,non-smoker4.\nGroup II: medical charges between 16k-30k, smoker and overweight.\nGroup III: medical charges above 30k, smoker and obese.\n\nThese three groups have its own trendline which can be later determined (trendline).\nThere is also one outlier or group I-a, where it is unclear as to what affects the medical charges increase to be between group I and II.\n\nThe above groups (I, II, III) can be used for risk profiling, where based on its profile, the associated risk related to medical charges can be determined. Since each group forms a trendline (simple linear regression), and can be categorized based on its smoker, and bmi profile. Based on this approach, one can estimate the optimum pricing for each risk profile (based on its medical charges).\nSee below flowchart for simple ilustration.\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n    A[Member] --> B{Smoking}\n    B --> |No| C[trendline Group I]\n    B --> |Yes| D{BMI Class}\n    D --> |Overweight| E[trendline Group II]\n    D --> |Obese| F[trendline Group III]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe next step would be using some of these knowledge to further investigate the likelihood (probability) of each risk profile based on its numeric (age-bmi) and categorical variable (smoker-bmi-region-sex).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nThis article was made as a replacement for medium article as part of Pacmann Data Science bootcamp assignment for Linear Algebra batch 8. The EDA notebook can be found in this notebook. Inside there will be a Youtube link as part of the assignment also."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Photo by Kelly Sikkema on Unsplash\n\n\n\n\nStatic Website Triumph\nStatic website is a website built upon a pre-rendered html generated from markdown. Static website triumph because the markdown format makes it easier for writing (at least for me), offered flexibility to write Latex to write equation like \\(\\frac{4}{3}\\pi r^3\\), a code block like this, or below, which makes it suitable for blog about programming/ data science.\n\nprint(\"Hey There!\")\n\nThe simplicity makes it easier to pour your words into sentences, sentences into a paragraph. You can focus about writing the content you want to write, instead of fiddling around about CMS. 1\nMy first personal website was initially built using jekyll-theme. I think the looks of the website is quite nice, given how easy for me to just forking the repo and making it my own. The theme is from al-folio theme, and by default it was designed for academic, supporting CV, list of publications (which handling bibtex better than Quarto at the moment), and of course blogging with categories, etc.\nI was convinced that static website is the way to go for me, but Jekyll-based theme is not as friendly-used as I thought It would be. For once, it uses Ruby Gem, which I am not familiar with and frankly the development is rather behind other languange. That means you have less change of finding answer online, compared to other language.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nI had multiple occasions where I just undo the whole thing, because when I ran bundle exec jekyll serve, it won’t render. Some dependencies issue, etc. Personally, if you plan to add more content to your blog, I would look the other way.\n\n\n\n\nQuarto by Posit 2\nEnter Rstudio Conference 2022, where a good amount of people gather in annual meeting for R-people. Among other important announcement (including changing their name to Posit, they introduced Quarto, an open source project to bring scientific communications easier and more inclusive.\nWhat is good about Quarto is it combines what was good about Rmarkdown, and make it more inclusive (as it drops the R from its name). Even more, the compatibility to pandoc engine, makes it easier to convert it from and to other format, this includes jupyter notebook, which is a huge plus for me. Mainly because I worked primarily in python, and the fact that I can work on jupyter notebook, do EDA, and when I am ready to post I just have to render the file before upload it to the website is godsend.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn order to make an .ipynb file can be rendered by quarto, it has to provide two things. One is the raw cell where the frontmatter (first cell in the image below) is, and second is the frontmatter has to specify which kernel/ jupyter would it use (mine is set to python3). See example image below, or read the docs for python for details.\n\n\n\n\nJupyter lab Example\n\n\n\nIf you prefer a tutorial video, I highly recommend Isabella’s video, in which she show some practical step-by-step when making a blog using quarto. \nNot only that, quarto allows use to generate multiple format from presentation (revealjs, pptx), article, report in pdf or docx, easily from a single markdown .qmd file. I’d probably write a post explaining about that in the future. Perhaps diagram below would simplify why I liked Quarto flexibility.\n\n\nShow Code\nflowchart LR\n  A[.ipynb] --> B(.qmd)\n  B --> C{quarto render}\n  C --> D[.html]\n  C --> E[.pdf]\n  C --> F[.docx, .revealjs, etc]\n\n\n\n\nflowchart LR\n  A[.ipynb] --> B(.qmd)\n  B --> C{quarto render}\n  C --> D[.html]\n  C --> E[.pdf]\n  C --> F[.docx, .revealjs, etc]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLastly, and here is my most favourite part (believe it or not) is the code block allows for copy and paste button! I tried to create a code block in my previous blog, and it just grey rectangular with no copy-paste button. I think this is an essential feature, as the theme is reproducible science. You wanted the minimize the barrier as low as possible, and this will definitely help.\n\n\n\nWhat Quarto Lacks\nThe good thing about quarto (simplicity) can be a cons for some people. When comparing to my previous website built on Jekyll, the default theme quality is still subpar. I need to do some personal tweaks to make it more appealing visually. Luckily, you don’t have to invent the wheel, as there are several blogs I used as inspirations for their custom theme. Below are some of my favourite authors, in no particular order.\n\nIsabella\nDanielle Navvaro\nTom Mock\nMatt Worthington\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nYou can use their website repo as inspiration, on how they change the font theme, size, page layout, blog setting, color theme. Pay attention to their _quarto.yml and theme.scss!\n\n\nLast but not least, the quarto project is still under heavy development. Quarto extension, some pre-release build version adding more capability 3, etc.\n\n\nHiccups and Hopes for Future Development\nI still have some issues when rendering a quarto markdown file (.qmd) with both R and python code.\nAnother error I have is when rendering to pdf due to tinytex installation issue 4. Which was apparently solved just by installing new pre-released version.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo recap, I extremely happy how my personal website turns out to be, and knowing that the project was supported by one of the most respected company in data-tech industry, I am hopeful about the future. Do try it out when you can!\n\n\n\nTill next time~ Arie\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nThis is one of the thing I am struggling when trying wordpress.↩︎\nPreviously R Studio.
