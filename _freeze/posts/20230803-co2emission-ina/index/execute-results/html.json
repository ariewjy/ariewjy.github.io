However, the country is also seeing an uprising of CO2 emission lately.

The most populous moslem country in the world, fourth most populous country in the world, country with more than 17,000 islands, a country with largest living lizard on earth named [Komodo](whc.unesco.org/en/documents/125037 \"Source of Featured Image\"), and among one of the most biodiverse ecology in the sea, land, and in between.\n\nInterestingly, Indonesia is also one of some countries where it produce CO2 emission less than its fair carbon share, as I shown in my previous blogpost @ariewijaya2023 , taken from research done by @fanning2023. @fig-top5-over-under-emit shows that Indonesia is among the smallest in terms of total share of appropriated emissions.\n\n![Top 5 Over and Under-emitting Countries with respect to their Carbon Budget](images/top5_overemitting_underemitting_countries.png){#fig-top5-over-under-emit}\n\n\n\n## Seattle Precipitation by Day (2012 to 2016)\n\n\n```{ojs}\ndata = FileAttachment(\"seattle-weather.csv\")\n  .csv({typed: true})\n  \nPlot.plot({\n  width: 800, height: 500, padding: 0,\n  color: { scheme: \"blues\", type: \"sqrt\"},\n  y: { tickFormat: i => \"JFMAMJJASOND\"[i] },\n  marks: [\n    Plot.cell(data, Plot.group({fill: \"mean\"}, {\n      x: d => new Date(d.date).getDate(),\n      y: d => new Date(d.date).getMonth(),\n      fill: \"precipitation\", \n      inset: 0.5\n    }))\n  ]\n})\n```\n\n",
