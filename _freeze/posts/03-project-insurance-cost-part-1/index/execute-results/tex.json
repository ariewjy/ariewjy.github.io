Insurance members are required to pay a routine payment (insurance rates) to the insurance company. This rate will be used to pay medical bill of the insurance members. therefore, determination of insurance rate becomes a critical component to ensure the sustainability of the insurance.\n\nIn this project, the author wanted to do an exploratory analysis based on known variable that may correlate with the medical bill of the said members. This project will be using personal medical bills dataset ([insurance.zip](/posts/03-project-insurance-cost-part-1/insurance.zip)) as the main source[^1], along with the included metadata below:\n\n[^1]: also available at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance).\n\n1. `age`: age of primary beneficiary\n1. `sex`: insurance contractor gender, female, male\n1. `bmi`: body mass index, providing an understanding of body, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height, objective index of body weight (`kg/m2`) using the ratio of height to weight, ideally `18.5` to `24.9`\n1. `children`: number of children covered by health insurance / number of dependents\n1. `smoker`: smoking\n1. `region`: the beneficiary's residential area in the US, northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest.\n1. `charges`: individual medical costs billed by health insurance\n\nAt glance, bmi and smoker would likely to induce a high medical cost of a person, while age, sex, children and region may contribute in some senses or the others. \n\nObjectives:\n\n- Analyze the **relationship** between multiple `variables` to `medical charges`\n- Characterize the **risk profile** of members, based on the said analysis\n- Determine if the **insurance rate** can be optimized for each `risk profile`\n\n## Setting-up\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code code-fold=\"false\"}\n#importing libraries\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport altair as alt\nimport hvplot.pandas\n\n#setting default theme\nsns.set_theme(style='white', palette='tab20') \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n```\nUnable to display output for mime type(s): application/javascript, application/vnd.holoviews_load.v0+json\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n```\nUnable to display output for mime type(s): application/javascript, application/vnd.holoviews_load.v0+json\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n```\nUnable to display output for mime type(s): text/html\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Importing Dataset\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code code-fold=\"false\"}\ninsurance = pd.read_csv('insurance.zip')\ninsurance.head()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n```\n/Users/ariewijaya/miniconda3/envs/minids/lib/python3.10/site-packages/IPython/core/formatters.py:343: FutureWarning:\n\nIn future versions `DataFrame.to_latex` is expected to utilise the base implementation of `Styler.to_latex` for formatting and rendering.

The insurance member can be characterzed based on the `smoker` profile, `age`, `bmi`/ `bmi_class`, number of `children`/ dependant, and `sex` profile.\n1. The `dominant` factor for a high medical charges is whether member is a `smoker` or not, followed by `age` and then `bmi`[^2]. \n\n      [^2]: the lowest medical charges (group I) may have obese in their profile, but since it is a non-smoker profile, the medical charges is lower.\n\n1. Other variable such as the `number of children`/ dependant and `sex` profile `affect the charges slightly`[^3]. \n\n      [^3]: around 10% higher in female, compared to male counterpart.\n\n1. There is a `strong relationship between age and medical charges`, with `3` strong group categorized by `smoker` and `bmi` profile. The big three groups are:\n    + Group I: medical **charges below 16k**,`non-smoker`[^4].\n    + Group II: medical **charges between 16k-30k**, `smoker` and `healthy to overweight`.\n    + Group III: medical **charges above 30k**, `smoker` and `obese`.\n\n1. There is also one `outlier` or group `I-a`, where the `number of children affects the distribution of the data`. The medical charges is between group I and II.\n\n[^4]: the BMI class shows a mix of all classes (from underweight to obese)\n\nThe above groups (`I, I-a, II, III`) can be used for **`risk profiling`**, where based on its profile, the associated risk related to medical charges can be determined. Based on this approach, **one can estimate the optimum pricing for each risk profile (based on its medical charges)**. \n\n::: {.callout-note}\nThe next step would be using some of these knowledge to further investigate the likelihood (probability) of each risk profile based on its numeric (age-bmi) and categorical variable (smoker-bmi-region-sex). \n:::\n\n",
