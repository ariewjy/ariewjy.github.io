## Introduction

Quarto to me is one of the best thing ever from Rstudioconf 2022 last year, POSIT (previously Rstudio) marketed it as an open source tool to create documents, presentation, books, website easy and inclusive for python users. This is huge, cause for the longest time, there is not an easy way to create website out of a notebook, nbdev might be one of those people to facilitate this, but not at the support and scale of which R-people get (Xaringan, Blogdown for Hugo, or Distill for Rmarkdown, etc).

## Why Creating Personal Website

A personal website is a great way to showcase our project to the world. Sure there is even a no-code platform like medium that you can use, but there are couple things I think it fall shorts on:

### 1. Pay Gate Wall

It is good if you are getting paid for what you were sharing on, but if your main purpose is for branding yourself (like me), then a pay gate wall would not do you any good (@fig-paygate). Especially, when you have just started on. Though it is fairly cheap, it is just another stopper for your first audience. Worse, the paid-subscription is only available for certain countries, Indonesia for example is not supported.

### 2. Reproducibility

When I do my first data-science project, I wanted to make sure that someone can just follow along and then get the same result as I was. Using platform like medium, I could not really do that, and I believe it was not meant for tutorial in details. Rather it was for an explanatory writing, rather than exploratory writing. Quarto with its rendered codes as an output, makes it easier to do just that. The below code cell is me importing libraries, importing a dataset, and displaying the table.

```{python}
#importing libraries
import pandas as pd
import hvplot.pandas
from bokeh.sampledata.penguins import data as penguins

#displaying first 5 rows
penguins.head()
```

What if I want to show the last 6 rows? I can just change the code.

```{python}
#importing libraries
import pandas as pd
import hvplot.pandas
from bokeh.sampledata.penguins import data as penguins

#displaying first 5 rows
penguins.tail(6)
```

### 3. Contents Ownership

If one day the platform (medium) goes bankrupt, I have no worry because I kept all my posts in a github, and my local folder. If the domain is somehow being hacked, I can just changed it. I own the content, and nobody else.

This gives you not only a total control, but also a freedom to experiment to your heart desires.

> Of course there are benefits of using low-code platform, but for my use case, I much prefer to have my own personal website.

## The How

Now if you are convinced, let's get to the core of this post, How Do I make one?

Now I should assume that you know what a github is, know what a terminal is, and know how to google. With that, there are really just three things that you need to have:

1.  A github account
2.  VS Code[^1]
3.  Content (notebook)

[^1]: you *can* just use a notebook, but some of the autocompletion, visual-mode (a powerful mode to make blogging easier) won't work.

With that out of the way, here are the following steps to create your first personal website:

### Creating a repo

Make a new repository with the same name as your github account. For example, if your github account is *johndoe*, then make a new repository named john.github.io (see @fig-newrepo).

![Creating a New Repo](images/image2.png){#fig-newrepo}

What's cool about this repo is it will be accessible later on as a domain for your personal website, completely free, and secure (https). This of course can be customized with a domain of your choice, but for now, we want to make this as easy as possible.

### Starting from a notebook

Let's make a content, using jupyter notebook, with a combination of code cells and markdown cells. I am gonna use the content in this post, where I load a libraries, dataset from palmerpenguins, and then I will do some plotting using altair to spice things up, cause why not. See below @fig-notebook for example.

```{python}
#importing libraries
import altair as alt
from bokeh.sampledata.penguins import data as penguins

import warnings
warnings.simplefilter(action='ignore', category=FutureWarning)

#plotting
brush = alt.selection(type='interval')

points = alt.Chart(
  data=penguins, 
  title="Palmer Penguins Dataset",
  ).mark_circle(size=60).encode(
  alt.X('bill_length_mm', scale=alt.Scale(domain=[30,60])),
  alt.Y('bill_depth_mm', scale=alt.Scale(domain=[12,22])),
  color='species',
  ).add_selection(
    brush
)

bars = alt.Chart(penguins).mark_bar().encode(
    y='island',
    color='island',
    x='count(island)'
).transform_filter(
    brush
)

points & bars
```

### Building the website

#### Create a Project

The first step is to create a set of folders for website project, using quarto by executing the following command inside the project folder:

```{bash}
mkdir posts
quarto create-project . --type website
```

which will output the following @fig-output-project, essentially the `post` folder would be where we keep our blogpost files.

![Output Projects](images/image5.png){#fig-output-project}

#### Convert Notebook to Quarto Markdown

The second step is to convert the jupyter notebook file (example.ipynb) to quarto markdown file (example.qmd) by running the following command:

```{bash}
quarto convert ./example.ipynb
```

which will create an output of qmd file which is important, because this would then be rendered to html (as shown in @fig-output-render) by running the following command:

```{bash}
quarto render
```

![Output Render](./images/image6.png){#fig-output-render}

#### Setting the Website

YAML file is basically where we fine tune our website settings. For this case, we need to move the `example.qmd` file to `post` folder, and *add* the qmd file inside the navbar, below the `about.qmd` as shown in @fig-yaml

![YAML setting](./images/image7.png){#fig-yaml}

### Previewing The Website

All things set, now all we need to do is preview our website by running the following command:

```{bash}
quarto preview
```

which will output our new website inside a browser as shown in the following @fig-preview. This is a preview mode which means, any changes made to the website, it will be rendered and displayed real-time. 

![Website Preview](./images/image8.png){#fig-preview}

Voila! You got it done! Congrats!

### Deploying the Website

There is a documentation on [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html) to do this, but in layman terms, there are essentially three things to do:

+ Create a `docs` folder and set the output to be that folder in _quarto.yml file as shown in @fig-docs below

![docs settting](./images/image9.png){#fig-docs}

+ Set the website repo setting to use the docs folder as the branch source as shown in @fig-reposettting below

![repo settting](./images/image10.png){#fig-reposettting}

+ Push your local Repo to the Github!

```{bash}
git add .
git commit -m "my first website"
git push
```

and you should see your website is up and running!
