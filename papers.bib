  title={Thru-Tubing Integrity Assurance in CO2-Injection Well Using Electromagnetic Corrosion Logging Tool: A Case Study in Far East Test Field, Japan},
  author={Aditya Arie Wijaya and Akira Endo and Sarvagya Parashar},
  journal={SPWLA Japan JFES 26th, Virtual Event},
  abstract={Despite the establishment of the Paris agreement to reduce CO2 emission in 2015, the energy demand continues to grow and is expected to be around 33% in 2035. Aside from the use of low carbon footprint energy such as natural gas, technologies like carbon capture storage (CCS) and sequestration are keys to maintain the amount of CO2 emission in the atmosphere. 
  CCS project needs to securely contain the CO2 injected into the formation by assuring the well integrity via corrosion monitoring. Although the well's life expectancy can be up to 50 years, frequent cycling of pressure injection may lead to pipe corrosion and reduce its lifespan. The well integrity assurance and monitoring are critical to ensure the maximum life expectancy and mitigate any risk to the environment from unwanted gas leaks to the nearby aquifer. 
  Thru-tubing electromagnetic (EM) corrosion logging tool is deployed to evaluate the pipe condition of the well after CO2 injection. The EM tool measures high-definition electromagnetic arrays from multiple receivers in the frequency domain. It uses the acquired frequency and magnitude of the transmitted EM signal and enables inversion modelling.
  The inversion modelling will then give an estimated metal thickness on each tubular, allowing further analysis of the metal loss calculation for pipe integrity. This study highlights the current tubing and casings condition in this CO2 injection well, which gives a reliable assessment of the corrosion status on the tubing and casing without retrieving the pipe. The result can be used to evaluate the well's life expectancy, mitigate any remedial action, and serves as the baseline data for future well integrity monitoring.},
