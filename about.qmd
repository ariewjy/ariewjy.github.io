Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am Arie!

I have a Geological Engineering background, and worked as a Geoscientist/ Petrophysicists with about ten years of experience in the energy industry. I am interested in subsurface data and its intersection with the sustainability to ensure the inclusiveness of energy security for everyone.

Recently, I made a web application to load a LAS file (a well-log data format), plotting, do some basic petrophysical analysis at [**plotpetrophysics.xyz**](https://plotpetrophysics.xyz/).

My free time spent between cooking, reading, or exploring the world of coding.

Thanks for dropping by!
