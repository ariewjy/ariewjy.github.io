Currently working as a Geoscientist in the Multi-national company in the Energy Industry. Spent the last decade, exploring, enriching my skillset in subsurface analytics, through field mapping, geochemistry, seismic interpretation, well-log, core analysis, and whatnot.

Started coding during the infamous pandemic of Covid-19, where I volunteer to teach students online about petrophysics. Which brings me to the problem where I could not find a good alternative of petrophysic software/tools to give a hands-on learning, that is free and hopefully OS-agnositc. Trying to tackle the problem, I developed code in notebook using python, to load well-log data in LAS file format and do basic petrophysical analysis at. What started out as just a notebook, becomes a web-app with some users at [**plotpetrophysics.streamlit.app**](https://plotpetrophysics.streamlit.app/).

When not working, I liked to think about how public policy and energy intersects, particularly in tackling climate change. I have a firm belief that geoscience will play a critical role in helping the world navigate around climate challenges. 

For what its worth, I sort of developed a unique skillsets that intersects between energy-data/coding. I also love to build a nice dataviz, some are published in twitter threads -- so catch you there!
