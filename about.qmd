Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am **Arie**!

I am currently working as a Geoscientist in the Multi-national Service company in the field of Energy, i.e. subsurface analytics, energy exploration, and geoscience analytics, in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.  

I have developed a web application to load well-log data in LAS file format and do basic petrophysical analysis at [**plotpetrophysics.streamlit.app**](https://plotpetrophysics.streamlit.app/), and particularly interested in finding an **intersection between geoscience/ subsurface with data analytics/ science**. 

In my spare time, I also enjoy sitting in silence, reading a book, or just let my mind wandering around the universe of thoughts.

Have a look at my [data science resume](./assets/data_scientist_resume.pdf).
